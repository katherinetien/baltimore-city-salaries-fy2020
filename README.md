## Background Information 
The 21st Century Cities Initiative at JHU conducts urban research to examine the implications of urban economic growth - a 2019 [report](https://21cc.jhu.edu/research/police-overtime-and-baltimore-citys-budget/) of Baltimore Police Department salaries revealed that the median pay for a Baltimore police officer increased by 60% from 2011 to 2018. Understaffed departments demanded officers to work overtime shifts, causing the drastic increase in median pay. 
## Business Question 
Looking at 2020 fiscal year's employee salaries in Baltimore, how can we categorize agencies using years worked, anuual salary, and gross pay of each occupation?
